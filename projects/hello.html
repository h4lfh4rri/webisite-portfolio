                            <b><i>Challenges</i></b> <br>The Hello Inspection app faced significant user dissatisfaction, with negative feedback primarily focused on its functionality and interface. Inspectors also voiced concerns about the lack of reusability for their inspection reports, leading many to seek alternative ways to sell reports to multiple home buyers. Additionally, there was a strong demand for a centralised platform to manage orders, track income, and streamline report-related activities. Recognising these issues, management decided to introduce a new feature—a marketplace for inspectors to sell their reports and efficiently handle orders and finances.<br><br>
                            <b><i>Solution</i></b> <br>To address these challenges, the marketplace feature was launched within the Hello Inspection app. This section allows inspectors to list their reports for sale, enabling reusability and catering to a broader audience of home buyers. The marketplace also provides tools for managing orders, tracking income, and organising all report-related activities in one place. Following the launch, surveys were distributed to gather user feedback, and the app’s performance and user engagement were closely monitored to assess the impact of this new addition.<br><br>
                            <b><i>Outcomes</i></b><br>The introduction of the marketplace brought noticeable improvements. The number of new users increased by 30%, with most engaging with the marketplace feature. Complaints about the app significantly dropped, and the drop-off rate decreased from 20% to 11%. Additionally, user satisfaction, as measured by NPS scores, saw an increase from 4.1 to 4.5. These results highlight the success of the marketplace in addressing user concerns and improving the app’s overall functionality and appeal.
