                        <p>
                            Hi there! I‚Äôm Harry, an empathetic web designer with a creative approach to work, based in Melbourne. I specialise in crafting intuitive, user-focused websites that help businesses thrive in the digital space.</p>
                        <p>
                            I believe in creating websites that align with business goals, deliver high performance, and prioritise user comfort. My designs feature visually organised, intuitive layouts, and I focus on creating clutter-free user experiences optimised for every device.‚ú®
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With years of experience in digital design spanning graphic design, digital marketing, and UX/UI, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working on diverse projects for businesses ranging from startups to large corporations. My expertise bridges both UX and UI. In UX, I work across competitive analysis, information architecture, wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing. In UI, I apply my visual design skills to create intuitive interfaces and responsive designs. Additionally, my understanding of foundational coding, including HTML and CSS, helps me collaborate effectively in the development phase of projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My super power is my ability to understand business needs deeply and turn them into effective design solutions. This skill doesn‚Äôt come from talent alone but from a meticulously built work pipeline that ensures we hit the goal, no matter the mood or inspiration. I am business-driven, with a strong focus on critical reviews, iteration and using practical approaches. I respect design systems and adhere to solid digital guidelines, ensuring consistency and functionality across all my design works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After hours, I‚Äôm a passionate sports fan, especially when it comes to the Premier League and NBA. I also love swimming and spending time in the kitchen, exploring different cuisines from around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <br><br><b>Hope this gives you a little insight into who I am. Thanks for looking around and feel free to stay in touch!</b> ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèº
